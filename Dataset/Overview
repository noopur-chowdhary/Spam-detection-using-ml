The SMS Spam Collection is a publicly available dataset of labeled SMS messages, created for research in mobile phone spam detection. It consists of both spam and legitimate (ham) messages collected from real-world sources.

The dataset includes:

425 spam SMS messages, manually extracted from the Grumbletext website, a UK-based forum where users report SMS spam. Identifying the actual spam content required extensive manual review of user-submitted claims.

3,375 legitimate (ham) messages randomly selected from the NUS SMS Corpus, a collection of SMS messages gathered for research at the National University of Singapore. These messages were contributed voluntarily, primarily by university students, with full awareness of public release.

This corpus is widely used for benchmarking and developing text classification and spam filtering models.
