Unsolicited and malicious messages remain a persistent threat to digital communication, enabling privacy breaches, financial fraud, and social engineering attacks. With the growing volume of SMS traffic.traditional rule-based filters often struggle to keep pace with the evolving tactics of spammers, such as word obfuscation and the use of shortened URLs. Deep learning offers a robust alternative by leveraging Neural Networks to automatically extract complex linguistic patterns and semantic context from raw text. By utilizing frameworks like TensorFlow, developers can build sophisticated architectures—such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks or Transformers—that classify messages with high precision, ensuring that legitimate communication remains uninterrupted while effectively neutralizing emerging threats.
